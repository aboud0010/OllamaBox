**OllamaBox** is a powerful Delphi wrapper for [Ollama](https://ollama.com) that allows developers to seamlessly download, extract, run, and interface with the Ollama runtime entirely within their application’s process. Unlike traditional setups that require background services or separate daemon processes, OllamaBox runs Ollama as a fully embedded, self-managed component—giving you complete control over inference, API access, and model management without leaving your app.

### :sparkles: Features

- :package: Download and unzip the latest Ollama release
- :rocket: Run Ollama directly in your app process (no background daemon)
- :electric_plug: Full access to Ollama's local REST API
- :brain: Stream results from models like LLaMA 3, Gemma, Phi, and more
- :file_folder: Custom model/data paths supported
- :white_check_mark: Simple setup, no dependencies outside of Delphi RTL
